# Welcome to Pizza Commercial Project üëã

In August 2022, I completed this project by utilizing a YouTube course as my primary source of guidance. While I acknowledge that replicating content from videos may not be the most ideal approach, I dedicated significant time and effort towards this project. Whenever I encountered difficulties, I would pause the video, carefully learn new topic and just then continue watching course. I tried to understand every part of the code and learned a lot of new things. So, I think this project should be in my portfolio.

## Features

- Whole app built using React
- Cart implemented using Redux
- All the cart items are persisted in local storage
- React Router to enable client-side routing and allow for a smooth, seamless user experience
- Work with server API using Axios
- Pagination using react-paginate
- Skeletons when pizza loading using react-content-loader
- Debounce when searching for pizza by keywords in order not to overload the server
- Filtering pizza by categories
- Sorting pizza by price, popularity, alphabet
- We can share links with settings of sorting and filtering
- Responsive and adaptive design. We can use this app for both mobiles and laptops

## Troubles

- We can search for pizza by words only within the '–í—Å—ñ' category due to API issues
